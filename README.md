## The Story

### The Hackathon Journey

In the heat of HetchHacks 2025, we set out to build something meaningful—a family hub that could bring families closer together through shared organization and communication.

**The Challenge:** Build a complete family management application from scratch.

**The Stack:** Vue 3 + Electron + Vite + LocalStorage

**The Result:** A fully functional desktop app with customizable widgets, shopping lists, meal planning, activity tracking, and more—all built with modern web technologies and packaged as a native desktop application.

### The Vision

This hackathon project is just the beginning. Our goal is to evolve Family Hub into a production-ready application that can run on:
- **iOS & Android** (via Capacitor)
- **Windows, macOS & Linux** (via Electron)
- **Web** (as a PWA)

We're documenting our journey, learning from our mistakes, and building something that families will actually want to use.
